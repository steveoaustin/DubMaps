frame specification
	size: frame is no smaller than a square, .25 * screen width // subject to change
		  frame is no larger than screen width by screen height
		  frame is re-sizable within these dimensions
	
	behavior: frame exits on close
			  frame is visible
				  
map specification:
	image: ALWAYS displayed at native aspect ratio
		   entire image is ALWAYS accessible via scrolling
		   image is never stretched beyond its native resolution
				display ratio never exceeds 1 screen pixel per 1 (native) image pixel
				and 5 (native) image pixels per 1 screen pixel 
				// revisit this (arbitrary) limit
		   
		   resizing: center is displayed by default if no path drawn
		   			 	center of path displayed by default if path is drawn
		   			 	prefer displaying entire path on-screen
		   			 		if full path cannot be displayed without breeching image spec
		   			 		at current screen-size, display the center of the path
   
   
notes: make a screen size helper class with screen width and height getter methods
	research enums?
	
	Path drawing: get max and min xy coordinates of each path to dictate resizing
